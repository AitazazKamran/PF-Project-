Title: C++ Candy Crush Game using SFML Library

Description: This project is a C++ implementation of a Candy Crush-like puzzle game using fundamental programming concepts and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It offers an interactive gaming experience where players can match colorful candies to achieve high scores and complete levels.

Features:

Game Mechanics: The game follows the familiar Candy Crush mechanics, allowing players to swap adjacent candies horizontally or vertically to create matches of three or more candies of the same color.
Grid-based Layout: The candies are arranged in a grid layout, providing an intuitive interface for players to interact with.

Power-Ups and Special Candies: To enhance gameplay, the game includes power-ups and special candies that can be activated by creating certain combinations. These special candies have unique effects, such as clearing entire rows or columns, exploding nearby candies, or clearing candies of a specific color.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it in real-time, encouraging players to aim for higher scores and compete with friends or themselves.
SFML Integration: The project utilizes the SFML library for graphics, input handling, and sound, allowing for a visually appealing and interactive gaming experience.
User Interface: The game features a user-friendly interface, with vibrant colors and engaging animations to create an immersive gaming environment.
By implementing this project, you will gain valuable experience in programming fundamentals Additionally, you will learn how to integrate external libraries like SFML to handle graphics and user input efficiently, creating a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.
